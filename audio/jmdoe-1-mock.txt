Maria Gonzalez is a 35 year old female who's here today with complaints of cough. So Maria, why don't you tell me a little bit about what's going on?

Guest-2
With your cough, So about two weeks ago I noticed a little tickle in my throat and then it's gotten progressively worse into like a deep rough cough where I've even been coughing up some like green mucus.

Guest-1
OK, has there been any blood when you cough?

Guest-2
No, no blood.

Guest-1
OK. And you said this started about two weeks ago, Yes. What other symptoms?

Guest-1
You had or Have you had any fever or?

Guest-2
Chills. No, I've just had a little bit of a headache, honestly.

Guest-1
OK. Do you feel like you're drinking enough fluids?

Guest-2
I think so, it's just nothing is quenching my thirst and keeping my throat nice and.

Guest-1
Yeah, It's just making you want to cough more. Yeah. Yeah. And any pain in your face at all, any nasal congestion, sore throat, anything like.

Guest-2
That just the sore throat. I haven't noticed any nasal congestion.

Guest-2
OK.

Guest-1
And then?

Guest-1
Can you think of anything that might have caused this? Is anyone else sick?

Guest-2
So I went on my friend's Bachelorette trip two weeks ago and one of the girls came.

Guest-1
Sick. OK, All right. So where did you go?

Guest-2
We went to Nashville.

Guest-1
Oh, nice. I think Nashville, it's a great city, Yeah.

Guest-2
You have to try one of those petal bars the next time you're there because that was so much fun.

Guest-1
Yeah, I've seen them. I haven't been on one. I usually just go for the barbecue and the music, which is great. Yeah.

Guest-1
Now, any other medical problems that I should be aware of?

Guest-2
I had a blood clot in my left leg about two years ago, so I'm on blood.

Guest-1
Thinners. OK. Now since you traveled, do you have any shortness of breath at all? No, no. OK. And have you noticed any leg swelling or anything?

Guest-2
Nope, I wear my compression socks daily so no swelling there.

Guest-1
OK. And you're following up with your hematologist. OK. All right. Now I want to go ahead and just do a quick physical exam.

Guest-1
I don't want you to worry. I'm going to be calling out some of these exam findings, but I'm going to let you know what that means when I'm done, OK?

Guest-1
OK. All right. I'm going to go ahead and just start by pressing on your face here. Any any pain when I press on your face? Just on my forehead a little bit, OK. All right, on facial examination, there's mild pain to palpation of the frontal sinuses bilaterally. Just going to look in your throat. OK, on throat exam, the uvula is midline, no evidence of any peritonsillar exudate.

Guest-1
On neck examination, there's no cervical adenopathy present. I'm just going to go ahead and take a listen to your heart and lungs. OK? OK.

Guest-1
On cardiac examination, the heart is in a regular rate and rhythm. I don't appreciate any murmur. Rubber gallop.

Guest-1
And on pulmonary examination, there's chorus bronchi bilaterally and occasional expiratory wheezing. So, Maria, what does all of that mean? That just means that you do have a little bit of wheezing in your lungs, and they sound a little congested.

Guest-1
So I just think you have pretty significant inflammation there. So let's just talk about my plan, OK? So for your cough, I do believe that you most likely just have a viral syndrome like a viral.

Guest-1
Bronchitis, I want to hold off on antibiotics right now, but we can go ahead and order a chest X-ray just to make sure that we're not missing any pneumonia. If your chest X-ray comes back positive, we'll go ahead and prescribe you some antibiotics, but in the meantime, this is really just going to be treated with supportive measures. I want to go ahead and prescribe an albuterol inhaler. It's one puff, one to two puffs every four to six hours as needed for any type of shortness of breath or excessive coughing you have.

Guest-1
And then I also want to give you something to help, you know, make it easier to cough up that phlegm. So we'll go ahead and prescribe some glyphenicin, 600 milligrams twice a day.

Guest-1
To help with any of that mucus. OK, any questions about any of that?

Guest-2
Can I take all that medication with my blood thinner? Yes, you.

Guest-1
Yeah. Have you gotten a flu shot yet?

Guest-2
No, I haven't.

Guest-1
OK. All right. So I think, you know, we're already seeing cases of the flu, so I think that we should go ahead. So from a preventative medicine standpoint, I want to go ahead and schedule your flu shot. I'll see if you can get it done today. Otherwise we can schedule it for a different time.

Guest-1
And then?

Guest-1
For your third problem of your history of your pulmonary embolism, you know to follow up with your hematologist, have your INR checked regularly? I'm assuming you do all of that, yes. All right. Any questions about any of that?

Guest-2
No, it all sounds good.

Guest-1
OK, great. Well, the nurse will come in and we'll get you checked out. OK. All right. Good to see you. Nice.

Guest-2
To see you too. Bye, bye bye.
